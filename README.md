# Calorie Counter

This is a test project, aimed to check how React, Redux, Reselect, React-Router and other play together.

## Installation

Either use `npm` or `yarn` _(I used latter)_ to install the dependencies:

    npm install
    # or
    yarn install

Then use `gulp` to build the application bundles:

     gulp
     # or, if Gulp is not installed globally on your machine
     ./node_modules/.bin/gulp

Use any of the web servers available to host the application. For instance, you could use `simplehttpserver` from NPM:

    npm install -g simplehttpserver
    # or
    yarn global add simplehttpserver
    # and then, in the root project directory
    simplehttpserver

Then go to your browser and check out application. In case with `simplehttpserver`, it's just [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
