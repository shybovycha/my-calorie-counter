# Calorie Counter

This is my sample project, aimed to get a hands-on experience on React, Redux, Reselect, React-Router and others.

## Installation

Use `npm`. Don't use `yarn` _(yes, I said that allegedly)_:

    npm install

    # this won't work correctly for parcel bundler:
    yarn install

Then use `npm run-script build` to build the front-end of an application.

To run the server, use `npm start`.

Then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to check out the application.
